Problem Statement:
The Kyc360 application requires enhancements to its entity retrieval endpoint to provide pagination and basic sorting capabilities.

Solution Overview:
To address this requirement, modifications are made to the EntityController and MockDatabase classes. Pagination is implemented by allowing users to specify the page number and maximum page size. Basic sorting capabilities are provided by allowing users to specify the property to sort by and the sort order (ascending or descending).

Changes Made:

EntityController:

Added parameters page, pageSize, sortBy, and ascending to the GetEntities method signature.
Implemented pagination by using LINQ's Skip and Take methods to skip items based on the page number and limit the number of items per page.
Implemented basic sorting by using a custom extension method called OrderByProperty, which dynamically generates sorting expressions based on the specified property name and sort order.
Modified the response to include pagination metadata such as total pages, total items, etc.
MockDatabase:

Added OrderByProperty extension method to allow dynamic sorting of entities based on the specified property.
Used the extension method in the GetEntities method to apply sorting before pagination.
Reasoning Behind the Approach:

Pagination:

Pagination is crucial for improving performance and user experience, especially when dealing with large datasets. It ensures that only a subset of data is retrieved and displayed at a time, reducing load times and resource consumption.
By allowing users to specify the page number and maximum page size, the application becomes more flexible and scalable, accommodating various user preferences and system constraints.
Sorting:

Sorting capabilities enhance usability by allowing users to organize data based on their preferences. It enables users to find relevant information more efficiently.
The approach of dynamically generating sorting expressions based on user input provides flexibility and extensibility. It allows sorting by any property without the need to hardcode sorting logic for each property.
Conclusion:
The enhancements made to the entity retrieval endpoint in the Kyc360 application significantly improve its usability and performance. By implementing pagination and basic sorting capabilities, users can efficiently navigate through large datasets and find relevant information with ease.
